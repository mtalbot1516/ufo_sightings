# UFO Sightings

## The purpose of the analysis
### Dana wanted to create a webpage allow users to filter a conglomorate of UFO sighting information, by drilling down on sightin dates, cities, states, countries and shapes.

## Results
### Please see image/webpage.png to follow along. To filter the webpage pleas scroll down to the "Filter Search" section on the left side of the screen. You will notice 5 options to search from date, city, state, country and shape. Simply enter a parameter into the input bar (follow the format provided in the unfltered table). Once entered it will automatically search for that criteria. Two add a second filter, keep the first filter and simply follow aforemention steps for a different input box. To start over, click the UFO sightings hyperlynk inn the top left of the page

## Summary
### One drawback with this new design is that you lose the filter button. This might cause some confusion on how to filter for those that do not have the instructions stated above. 
### To further develop this webpage, I would recomend allowing to search for duration. This might be important to some users. It would also be helpful to search for keywords within the comment sections!
